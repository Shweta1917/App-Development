# Experiment 5: Setting up React Native and Creating a To-Do List App

## 📌 Aim

To set up the *React Native development environment* and create a *To-Do List App* that allows users to *add, mark as complete, and delete tasks*.

---

## ⚙ Steps Followed

1. *Environment Setup*

   * Installed *Node.js* and *npm*.
   * Installed *React Native CLI / Expo CLI*.
   * Configured *Android Studio Emulator* or real device for testing.

2. *Project Creation*

   * Created a new project named **ToDoApp** using React Native.
   * Installed required dependencies (default React Native packages).

3. **UI Design (App.js)**

   * *Title*: Added a heading "My To-Do List".
   * *Task Input*: TextInput for entering new tasks.
   * *Add Button*: TouchableOpacity to add tasks to the list.
   * *Task List*: FlatList to display all tasks dynamically.
   * *Checkbox*: Allows marking tasks as completed ✅.

   * *Toggle Task*: Marks tasks as completed/incomplete (strike-through effect).
   * *Delete Task*: Removes a task from the list.

5. *Styling*

   * Used StyleSheet for modern and clean UI design.
   * Different colors for title, buttons, completed tasks, and background.
